# Randyland Directory

The Residents have had two large internet video projects: The Bunny Boy and 
The Randyland series. The Bunny Boy series was taken off of YouTube and put onto a 
DVD... but there are episodes missing and the DVD format isn't good for a long running 
series of short videos posted on the internet. So, the original Bunny Boy series 
experience seems to have been lost forever (unless The Residents do put out the 
remaining content).

The second series is currently still alive, although it is currently quite difficult 
to "binge watch" through if you either want to revisit it or watch it for the first 
time. The goal of this project is to collect all the In My Room/Randyland videos in 
one place so they're easy to locate and watch all the way through.
